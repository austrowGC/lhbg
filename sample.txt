* Compiling programs with ghc

Running ghc invokes the Glasgow Haskell Compiler (GHC),
and can be used to compile Haskell modules and programs into native
executables and libraries.

Create a new Haskell source file named hello.hs, and write
the following code in it:

> main = putStrLn "Hello, Haskell!"

Now, we can compile the program by invoking ghc with the file name:

> âžœ ghc hello.hs
> [1 of 1] Compiling Main             ( hello.hs, hello.o )
> Linking hello ...

GHC created the following files:

- hello.hi - Haskell interface file
- hello.o - Object file, the output of the compiler before linking
- hello (or hello.exe on Microsoft Windows) - A native runnable executable.

GHC will produce an executable when the source file satisfies both conditions:

# Defines the main function in the source file
# Defines the module name to be Main, or does not have a module declaration

Otherwise, it will only produce the .o and .hi files.
